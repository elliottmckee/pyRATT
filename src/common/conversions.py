"""
For the definition of any hard-coded conversion to be used througout a Simulation

Name and usage should be of the form:
var_in_meters = var_in_feet * conversions.FT2M 

For usage examples, see simulation_objects.py.

Ideally, these should have sources, but, ya know, i'm not that much of a tryhard.
