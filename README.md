# Python Rocket AeroThermal Toolbox

PyRATT is an Aero/Thermal Analysis tool aimed at *very* high performance (or high-speed) amateur rockets, or for performing more general 1D Transient Thermal analyses.

Primarily, it performs coupled Aerothermal/Thermal simulations of the temperature response of structural components like nosecone walls and fins, given a flight profile material properties, geometric parameters, etc. 

Secondarily, it aims to be a more general tool for analyzing more general, 1D transient thermal behavior, being able to handle a wide array of wall specification types, wall thermal boundary conditions, and more.


#  Notices
This is currently in what I am humbly going to call a "Pre-Release" state. There are definitely still issues (specifically with the GUI's being a bit finicky and not fully polished by any means), but I want to get it out here to gauge interest to see how much I should be developing this for others vs. just myself.

Please do let me know if you run into any issues with any part of it, or have any questions. This helps me know what to fix, where to add additional information, etc. 


# Demonstrations

Some examples of the results of the flight-thermal-simulation functionality of the code are shown below. 

These example files used to generate these simulations can be found in `pyratt/example_files`. Instructions on how to run them can be found below.
